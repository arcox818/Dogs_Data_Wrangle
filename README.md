# WeRateDogs Data Wrangling Project

This project is a lesson for the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree course.

The project is my data wrangling from the WeRateDogs Twitter account (https://twitter.com/dog_rates). I've gathered, assessed, cleaned and briefly analyzed the tweet data from the past couple years from the @rate_dogs account.

## Prerequisites

This data wrangling project uses Python and the packages matplotlib, pandas, numpy
The jupyter notebook is accessible directly from the project.
